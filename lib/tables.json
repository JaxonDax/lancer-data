    "Part (or all) of your body was too damaged to be cloned perfectly and a significant percentage of your clone body has been replaced with cybernetics. These high-quality prostheses aren’t obviously synthetic to casual observers. You don’t know the extent of the damage.",
    "Your clone has been fitted with a necessary but visible cybernetic augmentation – an arm, leg, eyes, or similar. It is a conspicuous prosthetic.",
    "By accident or malign intent, your cognitive profile has been loaded into someone else’s body. It might be a clone of a notorious or famous individual, with both enemies and allies who thought they were dead; or, you might run into the “original” person the clone was based on.",
    "Your clone has a unique appearance that clearly marks you as vat-grown.",
    "Thanks to a series of administrative mishaps, the appearance of your new body is drastically different to that of your old body.",
    "An additional, withered limb grows out of your clone’s chest shortly after your cognitive profile has been loaded. It sometimes moves on its own.",
    "There’s a conspicuous barcode printed on your clone body. The barcode means something specific to at least one powerful organization, but you aren’t privy to its meaning – at least not yet.",
    "In certain light conditions, it’s possible to read a script or inscription printed just under your skin. The script is all over your body and contains information contested by powerful organizations or entities – scientific formulae, maps, or something else entirely.",
    "Your clone body is unusually susceptible to solar radiation, viruses, bacteria, or some other common environmental phenomenon. You must wear an environmental suit to operate outside certain safe environments, which include your mech’s cockpit and your personal quarters. You can use downtime actions to make other rooms safe.",
    "Genetic material from a non-human source was used in the creation of your clone body. Whoever revived you won’t tell you the exact details or what long-term effects it will have, and they treat you like a science experiment. The new genetic material has caused a cosmetic change that is useful and visible, although able to be hidden.",
    "Whenever you try to sleep or rest, you’re stricken with vivid and persistent dreams, visions, and images of your death. You know they’re real but can’t reconcile the existential gulf between the experiences of the old and new versions of yourself.",
    "In addition to your cognitive profile, your clone body has been loaded with a digital homunculus of someone else: a basic digital reconstruction of a personality that is more like a piece of software than a person. While not technically sapient, it is very smart, and carries a message or secret with it.",
    "You’re plagued by the constant understanding or belief that the “real” you is actually dead, and you’re merely a facsimile of a dead person, implanted with someone else’s memories. You can’t establish the difference between the “you” that died and the “you” that exists now.",
    "In addition to your cognitive profile, your flash clone is woven through with a subdermal data-lattice: this storage device contains very dangerous and potentially unwanted information that is contested or sought by powerful entities.",
    "The flash-cloning process went awry, and you have been revived tabula rasa. In desperation, the technicians dump a stock personality construct into your clone body. Choose a new background and triggers.",
    "There are complications while growing your clone body: it has a dramatically reduced life expectancy.",
    "Something changed you – you now have persistent and intrusive mental contact with an entity or entities, human or otherwise.",
    "You keep having searing headaches during which you see brief flashes of what you’re pretty sure is the future. Sometimes these visions come to pass, sometimes they don’t.",
    "Knowingly or unknowingly, your clone body has been implanted with a mental trigger that places you in a receptive state when heard or activated, causing you to either follow a pre-programmed course of action or to follow instructions given by the person who activated you. These commands must be simple (e.g., kill, lie, etc.), and the GM determines who (PC or NPC) gave them. You might be able to overcome this effect in time.",
    "You come back with total amnesia regarding the time before your death, meaning you must be retrained and prepared from scratch. You lose all previous triggers and assign new ones up to your current level. Additionally, you may rewrite some incidental facts of your backstory.",
    "You are missing your digestive system and can only subsist on specially-formulated nutrient fluid. Attempting to ingest anything else may cause blockages or damage to the chemreactor that now sits inside your torso.",
    "You don’t feel pain anymore. You don’t feel anything. While it might seem advantageous to a warrior, you must now live with a constant routine of checks and caution. You could lean on the heat sinks of a Genghis and melt your arm off before you noticed if you aren’t careful.",
    "Your body is built from stock parts commonly used for subalterns. While functional enough, people tend to treat you as a piece of scenery or even furniture unless you make an effort to express that you are a person. Some might still not believe you.",
    "Your systems run hot. If you exert yourself too much - even just thinking too hard - your body starts to blaze with heat. Your cooling can take care of it under normal circumstances, but those fans are very loud.",
    "The interface between your brain and mouth had to be replaced… and whoever did so included some language filters. Swearing results in bleeping sounds and repeated attempts to overcome the filter may result in being locked out of speech entirely for a time, only able to say the phrase, “This user has violated the terms of service and their use of this device has been temporarily suspended.”",
    "NHPs act like you are one of them. Are you? Attempts to scan your skull for answers reveals only a heavily shielded container where your brain once was.",
    "Your peripheral vision is filled with advertising. Your ability to see is not impaired, but it is incredibly annoying and you don’t seem to be able to shut them off.",
    "You are stuck in a world of augmented reality. Unless you are paying close attention, you can’t casually tell the difference between real objects and people and those that are virtual or holographic.",
    "Your construction is distinctly nonhumanoid. While your functions are all intact, your alien morphology may present accessibility issues when trying to interact with a world built for people with two arms and two legs.",
    "You have nightmares about Deimos getting closer to you every night. Horus iconography frightens you. Have you abandoned too much flesh? Are you a living violation of the accords? You hope you never find out the answer.",
    "Part of your brain was too damaged to be restored. It was replaced with synthetic processors. You lose all ranks in one trigger but the augmentation has provided new clarity. Gain the same number of ranks in a trigger you do not possess.",
    "Your body is a horror to behold, tubes and wiring mingling with ragged flesh. Someone will pay for what they have done to you. Do you blame the one that killed you, or the one that brought you back?",
    "Your machine parts include some technologies that while unremarkable, are banned by several governments. You may find yourself with legal difficulties when confronted with representatives of those states.",
    "One hand was replaced with a high energy laser cannon. It’s awesome. You gain a medium signature energy weapon in addition to your normal pilot gear, but you have lost the use of one hand. Having a gun for an arm might also have social consequences.",
    "You don’t sleep anymore. You couldn’t if you wanted to. You still get tired, and must spend some time ‘defragmenting’, but it’s not the same. You will never again feel rested.",
    "When you try to print your mech, you find that some of your licences didn’t transfer over to your new life. Replace all licence levels in one frame with levels in others of your choice.",
    "When you pilot your mech, you feel subsumed into its being. Sometimes you even forget you have a body of your own. Sometimes, it feels like that tiny ambulatory thing you call a life is not really you anymore. Do you even need it?",
    "Your body is filled with secret compartments. Sometimes you find something hidden in one that you don’t remember putting there.",
    "Parts of your body are built using exotic technology that a lot of corporations would be very interested in getting their hands on",
    "You can be hacked just like any other machine. On the upside, you now have a heat cap of 6 and can overcharge and stabilize  while on foot; if you would overheat or take stress damage you instead become Down and Out."
